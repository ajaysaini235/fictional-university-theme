# fictional-university-theme

I'll add a description here down the road about this verbose repo

### to do list

add a custom query to single-campus.php after the the while loop around line 59. It should relate to campus events at that campus.
To reference a custom query, you can view single-progra.php custom query around line 74

## dependencies

[Plugins](coming soon)
[composer dependency](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) added to hide API key

## commands

``` gulp scripts ``` manual rebuild after js css changes [intro to gulp here](https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/) [docs here](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start)

``` sudo gulp watch ``` creates a proxy of web server that will reload whenever changes are made. Will also rebuild after js css changes. Note that sudo is required in wslfor auto reloading to work.

### WSL notes

Add notes for setting up WordPress development web server here down the road.
